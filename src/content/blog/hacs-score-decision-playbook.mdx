When your shortlist is large, speed and consistency matter more than intuition.

This playbook helps you evaluate integrations with the same sequence every time:

1. Check **HACS Score** to understand overall ranking.
2. Validate **confidence** to avoid weak signals.
3. Confirm **freshness** and open-issue pressure.
4. Compare alternatives side by side before final adoption.

## Why a single KPI helps

A single score removes decision noise. You still inspect raw metrics, but you avoid bouncing between disconnected signals.

## Suggested review workflow

- Start with a confidence threshold (for example `65+`).
- Filter on recent activity for active categories.
- Compare up to three candidates and keep only one winner.

## Final recommendation

Treat the score as a **decision accelerator**, not a replacement for domain judgment.
