Reliable publishing is not only about deployment success.  
You also need **consistent metadata** and **measurable performance thresholds**.

## Release checklist

- Canonical URL matches `SITE_URL` and `BASE_PATH`.
- Open Graph and Twitter tags are present on every route.
- `robots.txt` points to the production sitemap.
- Sitemap output reflects static routes.

## Performance quality gates

Use Lighthouse in CI with a minimum threshold so regressions fail early:

- Performance
- Accessibility
- Best Practices
- SEO

## Keep reports actionable

Treat PageSpeed as informational unless you control all runtime variables.
Use it to prioritize fixes, while Lighthouse CI enforces baseline quality.
